## Overview

Since this is my first attempt ever to build an interactive web page, I have encountered many obstacles and difficulties; however, through a lot of research and tries i was finally able to mimic the exact design of the project.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site on desktop and mobile devices.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

Screenshots of both the targeted desktop/mobile view are located inside the project's respository (On the front directory).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

- Advanced concepts of interactive design
- UI/UX basic principles
- SEO best practices
- SAAS 
- Adding responsiveness using Javscript and its libraries.
